Carolina Growth - Local Growth Playbook (v1)
============================================

This guide is a practical, no-fluff plan for local businesses that want a steady
flow of qualified leads. Use it as a checklist to tighten your website, map your
local visibility, and improve conversions.

SECTION 1: POSITIONING THAT EARNS TRUST
1) One offer per page
- Pick a single service + single audience per landing page.
- Example: "We help Charleston HVAC companies add 20+ service calls/month."

2) Proof above the fold
- Add one clear trust signal: review count, awards, or a case study result.
- Show a real number (e.g., "124 five-star reviews").

3) One primary CTA
- Repeat the same CTA in the hero, mid-page, and footer.
- Avoid split goals like "download + call + book" on the same page.

SECTION 2: CONVERSION FIXES THAT MOVE THE NEEDLE
4) Top-right phone number on desktop
- Use click-to-call on mobile.

5) Lead form length
- Best-performing forms ask for 3-4 fields: name, email, phone, company.

6) Show starting prices
- Use "starts at" or "most projects fall between $X-$Y" to reduce hesitation.

7) Add a fast follow-up promise
- Example: "We respond in under 10 minutes during business hours."

SECTION 3: LOCAL SEO CHECKLIST
8) Google Business Profile
- Use accurate categories, service list, and weekly posts.
- Upload fresh photos (exterior, team, work examples).

9) Location pages
- One unique page per city or service area.
- Include a map, local testimonials, and city-specific keywords.

10) Reviews system
- Ask every satisfied customer.
- Reply within 48 hours, even to negative feedback.

SECTION 4: PAID SEARCH STARTER KIT
11) Tight keyword groups
- One service per ad group, no mixed intent.
- Start with exact and phrase match.

12) Negative keywords weekly
- Remove junk traffic early (free, jobs, DIY, etc.).

13) Dedicated landing pages
- Each ad group gets a matching page, not your homepage.

SECTION 5: SPEED + TRUST STACK
14) Performance basics
- Compress images, lazy-load below-the-fold sections.
- Use a CDN for assets (Cloudflare is fine).

15) Trust stack
- Add a "Why us" section with 3 bullets.
- Show recognizable logos or brand partnerships.

SECTION 6: FOLLOW-UP THAT CLOSES
16) First response goal
- Under 5 minutes if possible.
- Use a 3-touch sequence: call -> email -> text.

17) Qualification script
- Ask about budget, timeline, and main goal in the first call.

SECTION 7: WEEKLY METRICS TO TRACK
- Leads by channel (organic, paid, referrals)
- Conversion rate (visit to lead)
- Cost per lead (paid)
- Lead response time
- Close rate
