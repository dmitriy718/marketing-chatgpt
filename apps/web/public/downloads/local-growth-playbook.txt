Carolina Growth - Local Growth Playbook
=======================================

This playbook is a quick-start guide for local businesses that want more leads,
more phone calls, and a steady pipeline of qualified customers.

1) Positioning that earns trust fast
- Pick one primary service and one primary audience per landing page.
- Use a clear headline: "We help [audience] get [outcome] in [timeframe]."
- Add one proof point above the fold (review count, years in business, or results).

2) Lead capture that converts
- Keep the form short: name, email, phone, business.
- Use a single CTA repeated 3x per page (hero, mid, footer).
- Offer a local incentive (audit, estimate, or quick plan).

3) Local SEO checklist
- Optimize your Google Business Profile (categories, services, photos, posts).
- Ask for reviews every week and reply to them within 48 hours.
- Build location pages for each city you serve.
- Add schema markup (LocalBusiness + service area).

4) Paid search starter kit
- Use exact match for high-intent keywords.
- Add negative keywords weekly.
- Create one ad group per service.
- Point ads to dedicated landing pages, not your homepage.

5) Conversion fixes that matter
- Put your phone number in the top-right on desktop.
- Add social proof in every section (logos, ratings, testimonials).
- Show pricing ranges or "starting at" numbers.
- Reduce above-the-fold clutter.

6) Follow-up that closes
- Reply to new leads within 5 minutes when possible.
- Use a 3-touch sequence: call + email + text.
- Offer a specific next step: "15-minute plan review."

7) Metrics to track weekly
- Leads by channel
- Conversion rate from visit to lead
- Cost per lead (paid)
- Lead response time
- Close rate
